This is a quick little mod to protect the z probe from crashing the switch. I have not tested this file yet but i have modified my carriage with a similar design. As a pin i used a nail with a 2mm shaft and roughly 5mm flat head. I used a drill files and sandpaper to make it a smooth fit. As a threaded insert i used cnc- kitchens flat m3 insert,to fit larger ones feel free to modify the step file or drill it out.
