# Jubilee-Z-probe-guard-mod
This is a quick little mod to protect the z probe from crashing the switch. I have not tested this file yet but i have modified my carriage with a similar design. As a pin i used a nail with a 2mm shaft and roughly 5mm flat head. I used a drill files and sandpaper to make it a smooth fit.
